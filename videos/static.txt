Hello my friends.
It's Sven Malvik here, and I have a blog.

The address is svenmalvik.com.
I post step-by-step guides about various Azure services.

Today I talk about Azure API Management and
how we can send logs from there to Azure Event Hub.

As my guide, I've chosen a post from my blog - that you can see in the background.

I think that went pretty ok, and I have some final words to you that may help both of us.

First: Please Like the video if you did so! This helps me.
Second: I give online-workshops about Azure API Management. Please reach out to me if you are interested.
And last: Maybe we can even become real LinkedIn-friends. Just add me and I will click accept.

See you!
