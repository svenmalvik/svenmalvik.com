This presents an interesting architectural decision point for our system.</p><h2 id=\"attempted-solutions\"><a href=\"#attempted-solutions\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Attempted Solutions</a></h2><p>There‚Äôs actually a policy-based approach in APIM that supposedly handles larger payloads:</p><pre class=\"language-xml\"><code class=\"language-xml\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token tag\"><span class=\"token punctuation\">&lt;</span>validate-content</span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">unspecified-content-type-action</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>ignore<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token attr-name\">max-size</span><span class=\"token attr-value\"><span class=\"token punctuation attr-equals\">=</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span>4194304<span class=\"token punctuation\">\"</span></span> <span class=\"token punctuation\">/&gt;</span></span></code></pre><p>However, this solution comes with its own set of challenges:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>The policy doesn‚Äôt seem to work reliably in practice</li><li>It adds another layer of complexity to our APIM policies</li><li>When combined with CORS handling, the policies become increasingly complex</li><li>Policy maintenance becomes a significant overhead</li></ul><h2 id=\"current-workaround\"><a href=\"#current-workaround\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Current Workaround</a></h2><p>As a temporary measure, we‚Äôve implemented a simple file size limit of 100kB. While this gets us moving, it‚Äôs clearly not the long-term solution we need for handling larger documents effectively.</p><h2 id=\"the-path-forward\"><a href=\"#the-path-forward\" class=\"heading-anchor\">The Path Forward</a></h2><p>I‚Äôm exploring a more robust approach:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>Moving files to Azure Storage Account</li><li>Maintaining only references in local IndexDB</li><li>Preserving user privacy by avoiding direct user-file associations</li><li>Bypassing APIM size limitations entirely</li></ul><p>While we could technically increase APIM‚Äôs limit to 4MB through a support ticket, I‚Äôm leaning towards the Storage Account solution as it provides better scalability and architectural cleanliness. This would also help us avoid the complexity trap of managing intricate APIM policies.</p><h2 id=\"deep-dive-into-apim\"><a href=\"#deep-dive-into-apim\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Deep Dive into APIM</a></h2><p><picture><source type=\"image/webp\" srcset=\"/assets/images/PD6uaSZcxS-440.webp 440w\" sizes=\"90vw\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" alt=\"Mastering Azure API Management book cover\" src=\"/assets/images/PD6uaSZcxS-440.jpeg\" width=\"440\" height=\"621\"></picture></p><p>If you‚Äôre interested in mastering Azure API Management and want to learn more about handling these kinds of challenges (and many others), check out my book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Azure-API-Management-Implementing/dp/1484280105\" rel=\"noopener\">‚ÄúMastering Azure API Management‚Äù</a>.

      "content_html": "<p>Hey AI enthusiasts! üëã</p><p>I‚Äôve been heads down working on Vippsi, our internal AI-powered conversation tool, and wanted to share what I‚Äôve been up to. Imagine having a natural conversation with your entire organization‚Äôs knowledge base - asking questions about policies, documentation, or reports, and getting instant, contextual responses. Instead of scanning through hundreds of pages, you can simply ask questions in plain language and get precise answers drawn directly from your documents.</p><p>As a financial services company, Vipps MobilePay faces unique challenges with AI adoption. While solutions like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google offer powerful capabilities, they aren‚Äôt always suitable for our needs. Financial institutions require stringent compliance measures and data privacy guarantees, while keeping costs manageable at scale. That‚Äôs why we‚Äôre building Vippsi as a custom solution that puts privacy and compliance first.</p><h2 id=\"work-in-progress\"><a href=\"#work-in-progress\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Work in Progress</a></h2><p>We‚Äôre expanding Vippsi to support multiple file formats:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>PDF documents</li><li>Word documents (DOCX)</li><li>PowerPoint presentations (PPTX)</li><li>Plain text files (TXT)</li><li>More formats coming soon</li></ul><h2 id=\"technical-architecture\"><a href=\"#technical-architecture\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Technical Architecture</a></h2><p>Let me explain how we‚Äôre handling your documents behind the scenes. When you upload a file, it‚Äôs processed in our backend but - and this is crucial - we never store anything. Think of it like having a conversation with someone who can read your document, answer your questions, but immediately forgets everything once you‚Äôre done.</p><p>Your files and conversations stay right in your browser using IndexDB storage. When you chat about a document, we convert its content to base64 format (a way to represent binary data as text) and stream it back to your browser. This base64 version gets stored locally and is used in your future conversations, making subsequent interactions quick and efficient while keeping everything on your device.</p><p>Here‚Äôs where it gets clever: Each time you ask a new question, your browser sends the base64 encoded content, which is much smaller than the original document. No need for storage on our end, no conversation history to worry about - everything stays private and under your control.</p><h2 id=\"current-status-and-next-steps\"><a href=\"#current-status-and-next-steps\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Current Status &amp; Next Steps</a></h2><p>The backend architecture is ready, while frontend work continues:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>Optimizing file upload experience</li><li>Implementing streaming UI feedback</li><li>Fine-tuning document conversations</li><li>Adding support for more formats</li><li>Enhancing conversation quality</li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance Vippsi‚Äôs capabilities!</p><p>~ Sven</p>",
