      "content_html": "<p>Hey AI enthusiasts! ðŸ‘‹</p><p>Iâ€™m excited to share significant improvements to Vippsi, our AI-powered conversation tool. Imagine having a natural conversation with your entire organizationâ€™s knowledge base - asking questions about policies, documentation, or reports, and getting instant, contextual responses. Instead of scanning through hundreds of pages, you can simply ask questions in plain language and get precise answers drawn directly from your documents.</p><p>As a financial services company, Vipps MobilePay faces unique challenges with AI adoption. While solutions like OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google offer powerful capabilities, they arenâ€™t always suitable for our needs. Financial institutions require stringent compliance measures and data privacy guarantees, while keeping costs manageable at scale. Thatâ€™s why weâ€™re building Vippsi as a custom solution that puts privacy and compliance first.</p><h2 id=\"whats-new\"><a href=\"#whats-new\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Whatâ€™s New?</a></h2><p>Weâ€™re expanding Vippsi to support multiple file formats:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>PDF documents</li><li>Word documents (DOCX)</li><li>PowerPoint presentations (PPTX)</li><li>Plain text files (TXT)</li><li>More formats coming soon</li></ul><h2 id=\"technical-architecture\"><a href=\"#technical-architecture\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Technical Architecture</a></h2><p>The new architecture moves document processing to the backend while maintaining strict privacy:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>Zero backend storage - no database, no conversation history being stored in the backend</li><li>Local-first approach - everything stays in your browserâ€™s IndexDB</li><li>Efficient file handling - backend processes files but never stores them</li><li>Smart streaming - content returns as base64 encoded chunks</li><li>Stateless design - subsequent prompts include encoded file content</li></ul><h2 id=\"current-status-and-next-steps\"><a href=\"#current-status-and-next-steps\" class=\"heading-anchor\">Current Status &amp; Next Steps</a></h2><p>The backend architecture is ready, while frontend work continues:</p><ul class=\"list\"><li>Optimizing file upload experience</li><li>Implementing streaming UI feedback</li><li>Fine-tuning document conversations</li><li>Adding support for more formats</li><li>Enhancing conversation quality</li></ul><p>Stay tuned for more updates as we continue to enhance Vippsiâ€™s capabilities!</p><p>~ Sven</p>",
