### Azure Event Grid for Azure Cache for Redis

Azure Cache for Redis now offers support of integration with Azure Event Grid. Azure Cache for Redis events will be triggered when a client exports, imports, or scales their cache instance, as well as when Redis updates are performed. These events can be triggered using Event Grid to subscribers such as Azure Functions, Azure Logic Apps, or your own http listener.
