*Microsoft updated it’s role based exam for AZ-301. It's now called **AZ-304** and launched last year. This certification is a great proof for why organizations should hire you. Some say it's the most difficult exam certification path as it is one of only two Expert level certifications for Azure. This post will provide you with tons of links that you should go through so you will master the exam for AZ-304.*

> Candidates for this exam are Azure Solutions Architects who advise stakeholders and translate business requirements into secure, scalable, and reliable solutions. Candidates should have advanced experience and knowledge of IT operations, including networking, virtualization, identity, security, business continuity, disaster recovery, data platform, budgeting, and governance. This role requires managing how decisions in each area affects an overall solution. Candidates must have expert-level skills in Azure administration and have experience with Azure development processes and DevOps processes.

A good place to start is [Microsoft Learn](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/browse/?products=azure&roles=solution-architect?WT.mc_id=AZ-MVP-5004080). There are many interactive learning paths that you can work through, all free. It's a good way to study and gain a good understanding of the services by actually using them.

I’ve listed a collection of links that are important to study and that are part of the skills measured for this exam. These are guide links and you should put some effort into all these topics. I really hope these guides will help you to pass the exam for AZ-304 and become an Azure Solution Architect.
