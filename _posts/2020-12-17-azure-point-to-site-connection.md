*I will demonstrate how to establish a point to site connection in Azure, and connect from a Windows workstation to a virtual machine via its private IP address. Azure Point to Site Connection is part of the AZ-303 exam for becoming an Azure Solution Architect.*

Sometimes we need to have our workload running on a virtual machine with no public IP address. At the same time we want to connect to it from our workstation. In the picture below I created already a Windows 10 Client workstation in the West Europe region. In the Central US region I created a virtual network with another vm, Windows 2016 Datacenter. I did not assign a public IP address to it, so it has only a private IP address. I also installed the Internet Information Server (IIS) on it. Right now it's only accessible from localhost and within this virtual network.

Our goal is to create what's described below.

1. Create a subnet gateway. The name `SubnetGateway` is important as it will be recognized as such of the virtual network gateway in the next step.
1. Create the virtual network gateway.
1. Generate the root certificate and client certificate.
1. Setup the point to site connection with the root certificate.
1. Establish a connection from the client workstation to the server.

We start by adding the subnet gateway. You find it under `Subnets` within your VNet. The name `GatewaySubnet` is important, and you can't change it. I leave the address range as it but feel free to give it a smaller range i.e. `/27`.

Now that we have the subnet gateway in place, we can create a virtual network gateway.

We set the gateway type as `VPN`, and the VPN type as `Route-based`. The subnet is set automatically to your subnet gateway. That's why the name is important.

If we scroll down a bit a must not forget to name a public IP address that we need for establishing a VPN connection. We won't use it directly for accessing the IIS.

Now we need to create some certificates. First we need a root certificate. Your organization may already have one. Out of this root certificate, we create a client certificate that we need to have on the workstation. 

First, login to the client workstation and open Powershell. Run the first command for the **root certificate**.
```powershell
$cert = New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -KeySpec Signature -Subject "CN=RootCertificate" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -KeyUsageProperty Sign -KeyUsage CertSign
```

Then run the following command for creating the **client certificate** out of the root certificate.
```powershell
New-SelfSignedCertificate -Type Custom -DnsName P2SChildCert -KeySpec Signature -Subject "CN=ClientCertificate" -KeyExportPolicy Exportable -HashAlgorithm sha256 -KeyLength 2048 -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My" -Signer $cert
```

You can see the result below.

Search now for `rootcert` and right-click on it to open it with Notepad or any other text editor.

Select the content of the root certificate so you can copy it.

We head back in to the Azure portal and to the virtual network gateway. In the menu is the `Point to Site Connection` that we will open. The Point to Site Connection will represent your workstation. Set the address pool of it and then the tunnel type `IKEv2 and SSTP (SSL)`. Then, we set the value of our root certificate as shown below.

Last, we download the VPN client on to our client workstation. I simply logged in to Azure from the client workstation and downloaded the VPN client from there.

Extract the downloaded file and run it. It will install the VPN client on the workstation.

Search for `VPN settings` and open it.

Now we can connect to the virtual network of the server.

I checked the private IP address of the virtual machine running the IIS, `10.0.0.4`. We open a browser, and v√≥ila. We can access the IIS from our client workstation with a private IP address.
