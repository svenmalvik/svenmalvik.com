yttxt: Avoiding the Agile Alignment Trap with DevOps
---

*I must admit that I'm very lucky, being a leader of an engineering team in a great Norwegian organization. The reason for that is simple. I can make things happen that are very important to me and where I have very strong opinions about, "Agile". What does Agile even mean? The video below explains very good why I never have taken those many existing methodologies serious. The most known of them are Scrum, Kanban and SAFe.*

The following 3 sections are extracted out of the great article [Characterizing people as non-linear 1st order components in software development](https://ameyakarve.wordpress.com/2012/07/22/characterizing-people-as-non-linear-1st-order-components-in-software-development-cockburn-us/).

## People are Communicating Beings

Exhaustive written documentation is not engaging, and it is a poor communication medium. The writer must guess at the audience. There's no feedback to the writer, and the writer does not get to use timing or emphatic signals, vocal or gestural inflections. For those who still think a book is best, consider the excellent but difficult book **Design Patterns**. Imagine that instead of trying to extract the meaning of the *Decorator* pattern from the paper, you could click on the page and see one of the authors explaining the pattern in a video clip. They would, of course, rely on tonal inflections, gestures, and timing to get the idea across. The same is true for the documentation we produced for building our complex systems.

## People Tend to Inconsistency

Lack of consistency is a common *failure mode* of humans. Methodologies that require consistency of action are **high-discipline** methodologies. The thing is that we are struggling being consistent which implies consistent over a long time.  People that were interviewed on projects were asked what caused them to succeed in the end. The single most common answer was, *“A few good people stepped in at key moments and did whatever was needed to get the job done."*

## People Are Not Static Elements

Some people like to make lists, some don’t. Some work best nights, some work best in the morning. Some like deadlines, some don’t. Groups vary similarly. Some cultures prize public self-scrutiny, others shelter people from embarrassment, and so on. Methodologies are largely group coordination rules, and so a recommendation appropriate for one person or group will be rejected by another. What applies to a consensus-minded group might not apply to a culture in which people wait for the boss to make a pronouncement.
