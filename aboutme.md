My name is Sven Malvik, and I am a developer who ...

- is interested in Microsoft Azure technology
- loves to speak at tech conferences
- ... and listens to techno music while coding :)

At daytime, I'm heading the Cloud Platform department in [Vipps](https://vipps.no), a Norwegian payment service.
