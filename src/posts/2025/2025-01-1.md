Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹

I'm excited to launch my new website where I'll be sharing my journey at the
intersection of AI and trance music. This space will be my digital garden where
I cultivate ideas, share experiences, and connect with like-minded people.

## What to Expect

Here's what you'll find on this site:

- **AI Leadership**: Insights from my work leading the AI Platform Team at Vipps
  MobilePay, where we're using AI to simplify complex workflows
- **Trance Music**: Weekly updates about my latest mixes, featuring both classic
  anthems and fresh progressive tunes
- **Tech Insights**: Thoughts about technology, leadership, and the future of AI
- **Personal Updates**: Stories and experiences from my life in Norway

## Why This Site?

I believe in the power of sharing knowledge and experiences. Whether it's
discussing how we're implementing AI solutions at Vipps MobilePay or sharing the
story behind my latest trance mix, this site is where I'll keep track of my
journey.
