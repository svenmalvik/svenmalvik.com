  A quick post about how I write my Git commit messages. I don't really like 
  the messages that GitHub Copilot creates, so I use Cursor Chat instead. 
  I'll show you my current method and another way I discovered while writing this post.

# Crafting Better Git Commit Messages with AI 🚀

Hey fellow developers! Today, I want to share something that's been a game-changer in my daily workflow - how I craft meaningful Git commit messages using AI, without relying on GitHub Copilot.

## Quick Method in Cursor

Listen! 🎯 While writing this post, I stumbled upon this quick way to generate commit messages:

1. Open Cursor's Source Control panel (look for the branch/Y-shaped icon in the sidebar)
2. Find the commit message input field
3. Click the AI-generated commit message button (it looks like a star ⭐)

## My Personal Method: Using Cursor Chat

But here's how I personally prefer to do it:

1. 📝 Open Cursor's Chat
2. 🔍 Ensure no file is in the context
3. ⚡️ Type `@PR` and hit Enter (this adds @PR (Diff with Main Branch) to the context)
4. 💬 Use this magic prompt:
   ```
   You are an engineer who wants to commit changes to the remote codebase. Your job is it to provide a short commit message about the recent changes as a one-liner.
   ```
5. ✨ Hit Enter and voilà - perfect commit messages every time!

And that's it! While both methods use AI to generate commit messages, there's an interesting difference: my personal method always creates a concise one-liner, while the quick method might generate multi-line messages.

Listen! 💡 I personally prefer the one-liner approach as it keeps my git history clean and scannable. But now you know both methods - try them out and see which style works better for your workflow!
