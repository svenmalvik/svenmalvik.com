Picture this: AI technology by day, trance beats by night. That's my world, and I love every minute of it! I'm passionate about two things: making AI accessible to everyone and creating trance music that moves people.

## Leading AI Innovation at Vipps MobilePay

I lead our AI Platform Team, where we're building Vippsi - an AI assistant that helps teams work smarter by understanding and leveraging your company's knowledge. Think of it as a specialized colleague who knows your organization inside and out.

## Tech Journey & Expertise

Here's a bit about my tech background:
- Former Microsoft Azure MVP
- Author of "Mastering Azure API Management"
- Led the Azure platform merger of MobilePay and Vipps
- Built systems handling millions of Nordic transactions

Listen! Want to dive deep into API Management? Check out my book ["Mastering Azure API Management"](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Azure-API-Management-Implementing/dp/1484280105). It's your practical guide to building enterprise-grade API architectures.

## What Gets Me Excited Every Day âœ¨

My daily adventures include:
- Building Vippsi with TypeScript and Python
- Exploring the frontiers of Large Language Models
- Empowering teams with AI capabilities
- Making fintech more innovative through AI
- Creating spaces for AI experimentation

The best part? Seeing that "aha!" moment when people realize how AI can transform their work. It's not about replacing humans - it's about giving them superpowers!

## The Trance Side of Life ðŸŽ§

When the code stops flowing, the music starts! As a trance DJ, I live for those moments when the perfect mix takes people on a journey. Catch my weekly mixes on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@svenmalvik), where I showcase the latest and freshest trance tracks straight from Beatport.
