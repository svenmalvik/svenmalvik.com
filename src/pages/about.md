Hey there! I'm Sven, and I've got two big passions in life: making AI work for
everyone and mixing trance music that makes people feel something special.

## Building AI at Vipps MobilePay

I'm having the time of my life leading our AI Platform Team. We're creating this
amazing tool called Vippsi - imagine having an AI assistant that actually
understands your company's knowledge and helps everyone work smarter. Pretty
cool, right?

## Background & Expertise

As a former Microsoft Azure MVP and author of "Mastering Azure API Management",
I've spent years helping teams build better cloud solutions. I led the Azure
platform merger of MobilePay and Vipps, creating a unified foundation that
handles millions of transactions across the Nordics.

Want to learn more about API Management? Check out my book
["Mastering Azure API Management"](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Azure-API-Management-Implementing/dp/1484280105) -
a practical guide to designing and implementing an API-centric enterprise
architecture.

Every day is different, but here's what gets me excited:

- Crafting Vippsi using TypeScript and Python
- Exploring what's possible with Large Language Models
- Helping teams discover their "wow, AI can do that?" moments
- Finding ways to make fintech more innovative through AI
- Creating a playground where everyone can experiment with AI

I love seeing people's faces light up when they realize how AI can transform
their work. It's not about replacing humans - it's about giving them
superpowers!

## My Trance Journey

When the workday ends, my other passion takes over. I'm a trance DJ, and there's
nothing quite like the feeling of mixing tracks that take people on a journey.
Every week, I share new mixes on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@svenmalvik)
where I blend everything from classic anthems to the latest progressive tunes.

## Say Hi!

I'm always up for a chat about:

- The latest AI developments
- Your favorite trance tracks
- Tech leadership experiences
- Or just life in general!

Find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/svenmalvik) for the tech stuff
or [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@svenmalvik) for the trance vibes. Check
out my [blog](/blog) where I share thoughts about both worlds.

Whether it's through code or music, I believe in creating experiences that make
a difference. That's what drives me every day!
