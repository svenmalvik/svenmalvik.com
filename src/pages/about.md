Picture this: AI technology by day, trance beats by night. That's my world, and I love every minute of it! I'm passionate about two things: making AI accessible to everyone and creating trance music that moves people.

## Leading AI Innovation at Vipps MobilePay 🤖

Right now, I'm having an absolute blast leading our AI Platform Team. We're building something special called Vippsi - think of it as your company's very own AI brain that helps everyone work smarter. It's like having a super-intelligent colleague who knows everything about your organization!

## Tech Journey & Expertise 🚀

Here's a bit about my tech background:
- 📚 Former Microsoft Azure MVP
- 📖 Author of "Mastering Azure API Management"
- 🌐 Led the Azure platform merger of MobilePay and Vipps
- ⚡ Built systems handling millions of Nordic transactions

Listen! Want to dive deep into API Management? Check out my book ["Mastering Azure API Management"](https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Azure-API-Management-Implementing/dp/1484280105). It's your practical guide to building enterprise-grade API architectures.

## What Gets Me Excited Every Day 💡

My daily adventures include:
- 🔧 Building Vippsi with TypeScript and Python
- 🧠 Exploring the frontiers of Large Language Models
- 💪 Empowering teams with AI capabilities
- 💳 Making fintech more innovative through AI
- 🎮 Creating spaces for AI experimentation

The best part? Seeing that "aha!" moment when people realize how AI can transform their work. It's not about replacing humans - it's about giving them superpowers!

## The Trance Side of Life 🎧

When the code stops flowing, the music starts! As a trance DJ, I live for those moments when the perfect mix takes people on a journey. Catch my weekly mixes on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@svenmalvik), where I showcase the latest and freshest trance tracks straight from Beatport.
